        <p>Hi there, this is Enji from USC Viterbi college. I'm currently a freshman majoring in computer science.</p>
        <p>An interesting fact about my major: Even though I love CS right now and I'm glad I could pick this major as my focus, I actually said "I would never go for CS in my future. Never." when I was a freshman in high school. The reason was that I felt so frustrated when I gave it a try and found out I have to spend more than 3 hours to debug for a simple typo. After that, I didn't touch CS for my whole high school life. Fortunately, I took a computer science course as a senior. In that course, I explored many interesting websites and found that it was so excited to see the computer react as exactly what I told it. Thus, after I got accepted as a student majoring in EE, I didn't wait for a second and transfered to CS, and I'm still happy for my choice at that time.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to read novels, go to gym, and play some video games, just as most of the boys. I'm currently teaching myself Javascripts and Programming in Swift. So if you have any good resources, please let me know! </p>
